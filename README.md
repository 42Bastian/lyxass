# lyxass
Atari Lynx and Jaguar Macro Assembler

Building:
The sources can be build either on Linux (or any other \*nix) or on Windows using either cygwin or mingw or M$ Visual Studio.
Just do "make".

lyxass checks environments variables BLL_ROOT for Lynx sources and BJL_ROOT for GPU/DSP sources when using `< >` for include paths.l

Have fun
